name: lightgbm              # Model name
objective: regression       # Machine learning task type
boosting: gbdt              # Boosting type
learning_rate: 0.05         # Learning/shrinkage rate
num_leaves: 31              # Max number of leaves in one tree
device: cpu                 # Device for the tree learning
max_depth: -1               # Limit the max depth for tree model (<= 0 means no limit)
min_data_in_leaf: 10        # Minimal number of data in one leaf
feature_fraction: 0.9       # Randomly selected subset of features on each iteration (tree)
bagging_fraction: 0.9       # Like feature_fraction, but this will randomly select part of data without resampling
bagging_freq: 5             # Frequency for bagging
verbose: -1                 # Controls the level of LightGBMâ€™s verbosity
metric: l1                  # Metric to be evaluated on the evaluation set
max_epochs: ${max_epochs}   # Number of boosting iterations
patience: ${patience}       # Number of boosting iteration without improving
